This time we're gonna build a music genre classifier using a multi-layered perception network. Cool. So music genre classification is a type of problem that's called a classification problem, right? So what's a classification problem? Well, classification problem is I have uh a bunch of data and I want to classify that. So I have for example, like a bunch of uh tracks and I want to classify them into like rock music, uh blues music or like classical music, specifically what we're doing today is called multi class classification. So we have a bunch of tracks and those vinyls would uh want to like represent those tracks and then we want to classify them into a bunch of different genres, right? So it could be classical, it could be death metal could be EDM and whatever, right? But it's more than two and multi class classification is opposed to binary classification where we just have two categories out there. So for example, it could be uh tell me",

I'm gonna introduce you the multi-layered perception, which is a simple neural network and we're gonna see how it works and the math behind it. So to get started, let's take a look at an old friend, the artificial neuron. So if you remember, we, we said that an artificial neuron is a computational unit that's able to process some information and do some transformation on it. Well, the question is, so if the artificial neuron is a computational unit, why do we need a neural network? Isn't an artificial neuron good enough by itself? Well, it turns out that if you want to work on quite complex problems, you want to scale up to networks of neurons or neural networks because a single neuron is really good if you are",

And so we, we do for doing that, we do a four, a four loop uh through all the work we iterate through all the weights. And then at each layer, we do two things, we calculate the net inputs first. And we do that with a matrix multiplication between the activation and the weights. And then we actually calculate the activations. And we do that by passing the net inputs to the sigmoid activation function. And then finally, after we are at the end of this journey, we just return the activations great.

Uh What we're gonna do today really is uh preparing uh it's basically like doing some preprocessing on a music data set. So what we want to do really is extract the inputs and the targets. So basically like the uh labels and the MFCC uh from music data set and store that in adjacent files. So that then we can use it when we actually train our neural network. So, first of all, what we need for a music genre classifier is a music data set. And uh luckily there's a great one on the Marias uh website where we have this uh data set for genre classification. So you can go to the website and download it here. I'm not gonna do that because I already have it. But uh",

So if you remember, so this is an artificial neuron, this X one X two X three are the inputs W 1 W-2 W three and the weights. And here we have the neuron that does two things. So one is the weighted sum or the net input. And then we have the activation. So let's just focus on the net input. Now. So if you remember the net input age is the weighted sum over all the inputs. In other words, is X one input, one by weight one plus input, two by weight two plus input three by weight three. Now if you look at these, you may uh just think that we can rewrite that using the dot product because it's basically the, the very same result.

And as the activation uh this time, we want to use soft maths and if you guys remember soft, what soft maths does is it creates a probability distribution kind of like scores like for each of these like 10 neurons, 10 possible like categories. And if we add up like all of these like values for the 10 different genres, then we're gonna get one. So how do we do predictions there? Well, we just like take the the index with the highest value and we're gonna map that onto like a relative genre.",

Cool. So um given like, as I mentioned in my previous video, I'm gonna be focusing on audio like in music. So applications in deep learning uh for audio music. So here I just wanted to give you a little bit of an idea of what we can do with deep learning in audio. So we can use deep learning for uh tasks like speech recognition for uh classifying emotions just by looking at or analyzing voice or for doing things like no recognition. And in the music side of things that sometimes gets called music information retrieval. We can use deep learning to extract or to classify music genre to understand the different types of instruments that we have in a song and then also for doing mood classification. So we have a bunch of different songs and we should decide, is this a happy song or is this a sad song?",

So we la in the last video, we looked into simple R and MS and we saw that they're really good for time series type of data. But we also found out that they have a few issues mainly that they really don't have a long term memory and that's uh the network can't really uh use like context from the past. And that's because like it can't learn patterns with a long dependencies.

And so basically the output Y is a function of the activation function F where we pass in H which is the net input. So now there are a gazillion different activation functions in neural networks. But we'll be looking at one in particular right now because it's quite simple and it's very common as well called the sigmoid function. And so here on the right, you have the function Excel itself and on the left you have the graph of the function. So why is this a good function for being like an activation function? Well, first of all, it's bounded between zero and one. Then as you see here, it's a very smooth function. It doesn't have any discontinuity and this is great because it can be uh differentiated. So you can calculate the derivatives of this function quite easily. And so what this function does is basically modulating all the uh inputs and the net input into an output that's uh limited between zero and one,",

So it has an architecture where basically the input signal is moving from left to right. And specifically the model that we want is the same that we used in our previous video where we built uh the same model, the same neural network from scratch. Now, if you want to know like how that's done, just go back and watch uh our pre uh my previous video, um you should have done this by now but you haven't just go and check that out. But again, what we want is a model where we have an input um layer where we have two neurons, then we want a hidden layer with five neurons and finally an output layer with one neuron. So let's build this nice uh network to do that. We do TF dot Kas dot layers. And the type of layer that we want is a dense layer and a dense layer is a fully connected layer which basically connects all the neurons from the previous layer with the current layer nice. And so the uh the dense layer",

Now there's a lot of data in which order is extremely important. That's true. For example, like for text and words. So let's analyze for example, the the sentence Anna loves John. Well, here order is very important because Anna loves John is very different from John loves Anna, right? And the point being that like order is so important that many like bad things can happen. Like if you don't understand whether like Anna loves you or John loves Anna, right? OK.
