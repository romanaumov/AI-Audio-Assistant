Last time we introduced the extraction pipelines for both time domain and frequency domain features. This time, I'm going to be introducing time domain audio features specifically, I'm going to focus on a few very important types them in audio features and explain the theory behind them. But before we get started, let me recall you once uh remind you once again about the sound of the I Slack community. This is a community of people interested in all things A I audio A I music audio signal processing. So if you want to improve your knowledge in the field and network with great people, I highly suggest you to go check out the sign up link that I've left in the description below now on to the good stuff. OK. So these are the 310 domain features that we'll be uh focusing on today. So these are amplitude envelope root mean square energy and zero crossing rate. So all of these features",

And finally, if we want to look at the speech recognition uh uh like space, we can use zero crossing rate for distinguishing between signals which contain like voice and signals that are like usually that are unvoiced. And that's because uh when we are like dealing with like voice, um voice signal, we usually have like a zero crossing rate like that is like lower than what we have like in unvoiced like pieces of signals. And that probably has to do with the fact that like those invoiced parts are like noisier. And yeah, and that's the case in the next few videos, we'll get our hands dirty and",
