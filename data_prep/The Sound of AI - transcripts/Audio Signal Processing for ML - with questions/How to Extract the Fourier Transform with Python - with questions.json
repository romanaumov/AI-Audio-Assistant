Last time we looked uh at the theory behind the discrete fourier transform and the fast fourier transform, which is a flavor of discrete fourier transform. This time, I want to actually extract the fourier transform coefficients using Python and specifically Noon P. Beyond that, I'm going to show you also a bunch of uh different um magnitude spectra for instruments which play the same note so that we can at least have a glance into why we perceive their timer uh differently. OK. So let's get started with our Gipson notebook. And here, first thing I want to import a few libraries that are gonna be useful for our purpose today.",

So uh here we have like this complex number and we know that this complex number provides information both about a phase as well as uh the magnitude. And now the thing is that for most applications in A IO A, we usually don't care that much about face. So when we analyze signals, what we really care is to understand how much is each frequency is present in a, in an audio signal. And for that, we just need the magnitude. So what we do usually we it's discard the information about phase and we only retain information about the magnitude. And so we move from the fourier coefficients uh to the magnitude spectrum. So how do we do that? Well, that is very simple because we just like take the absolute value of the fourier coefficients. In other words, we can take the magnitude spectrum of the violin",
