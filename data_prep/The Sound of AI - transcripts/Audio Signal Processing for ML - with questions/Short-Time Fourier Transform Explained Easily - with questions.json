Last time we extracted the discrete fourier transform with Python and li browser from a bunch of audio files. This time we are back to theory specifically, we'll be addressing a key topic in A I audio, the short time fourier transform. So why is the short time four so important? Well, that's because it enables us to extract spectrograms and spectrograms are really the probably the most important feature that you can feed to deep learning audio models. But before we get into the in and out of the of the short time period transform, I want to remind you once again about the sound of the Eye Slack community on this community, you'll find people with interests in A I music A I audio, audio digital signal processing. And so if you're there, you can ask for feedback, you can share your projects and network with a bunch of very cool people. So if you're interested in joining, I'll leave you the sign up link in the description section below. OK. Now on to",
