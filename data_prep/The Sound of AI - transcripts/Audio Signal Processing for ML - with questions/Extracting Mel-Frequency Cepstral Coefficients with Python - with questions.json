Last time we looked at mad frequency CEPT coefficients from a theoretical standpoint. In this video, I want to show you how you can extract MF CCS using Python and Libros. So let's get started with this Jupiter notebook. So the first thing I want to do is just import a bunch of libraries that we'll be using. So I'll import Li Brosa Libros dot display, ipython dot display, uh Pylot and then pie. So let's do that. Next thing we want to load uh an audio file. So which file are we gonna load? So it's a file that we, you should be familiar with by. Now it's a, a short passage of a piece from clothes, the Bey. So we're talking about classical music here.",
