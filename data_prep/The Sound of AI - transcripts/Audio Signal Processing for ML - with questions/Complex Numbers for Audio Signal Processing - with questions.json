This time we'll pick up where we left last time where we talked about fourier transform and arrived at the point where we said, well, we need to know about complex numbers for moving forward and understand fourier transform even better than just like the intuition level. So this time, we'll look into the fundamental concepts behind numbers. And all of this information is going to be very useful for you to understand the deeper concepts behind uh audio signal processing. But before we get started, I want to remind you once again about the sound of the Ice Luck community, which is a community with people interested in all things A I music A and all your signal processing. So you can go there, hang out with very interesting people and uh network with them, ask for feedback and just share your ideas. So if you're interested and you're not signed up yet, just go check out the sign up link to the workspace Slack workspace in the description below. But now let's move on to the topic of today's video. The complex numbers. So why should we butter with complex numbers in the first place? Well,",

Well, because it has all the fundamental elements of mathematics and symbols, it has zero, it has one, it has pi which is so omnipresent in mathematics, it has I this made of imaginary unit and it has E so this is just wonderful. But for this to work, we need for this exponential right to be equal to minus one. So let's check out, let's see like if this actually is the case, let's start from the Euler formula here and here we can see uh that. Um so if we plug pi into like this formula, we'll see that cosine of pi is equal to one equal to sorry minus one plus I times sine of pi and sine of pi is equal to zero. In other words, we are adding up minus one plus I times zero, which is zero. So all of this guy gives us back minus one. So it checks out that's great.
