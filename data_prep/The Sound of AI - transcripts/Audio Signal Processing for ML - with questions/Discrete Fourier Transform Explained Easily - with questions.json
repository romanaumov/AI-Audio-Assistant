This time we continue our quest, our journey into the wonderful world of the fourier transform. Specifically, we'll look at the discrete fourier transform. But before getting like our heads down into the DM T or Discord fourier transform, I want to remind you once again about the sound of A I Slack community, which is a community where you can just learn a lot of stuff about audio processing and A I music in general and you can network with very cool people. So if you're interested in joining, I'll leave you the sign up link in the description below. But now let's move on to the cool stuff. OK. Last time, if you guys remember we defined this beast of an equation here, which in other words is simply the fourier transform expressed through complex numbers. Now, I'm not gonna get into the details here and I take for granted that you already know that. But if that's not the case, I suggest you to check out this video, which by the way is my last video.

One last thing that I want to cover is a particular algorithm that's very handy for calculating the discrete fourier transform. And not surprisingly because of how it works, it's called the fast fourier transform. And this algorithm was discovered by um Gauss and fourier almost like at the same time. So the problem is that with the discrete fourier transform, we have like a way of like computing like this fourier coefficients that's quite expensive. The number of operations that we need to carry out is capital N squared, which is quite a lot if you have like a lot of um samples. So the great thing about the fast four A transform is that it, it is way more efficient. And the number of operations that we need to calculate here is given by N multiplied by log two of N.",
