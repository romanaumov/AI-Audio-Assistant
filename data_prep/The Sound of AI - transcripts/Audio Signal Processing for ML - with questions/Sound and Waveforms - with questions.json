This time, we are basically starting the whole series and it's going to be quite theoretical because I want to introduce a few basic ideas. So what's sound? What are waveforms? So what's frequency and how can we use all of those uh notions in audio processing? OK. So let's get started with the basic idea here. So what what is sound well uh sound is produced by uh vibrating objects. So these objects vibrate and these vibrations cause our air molecules to oscillate and to bump into each other and by bumping into each other, these uh air molecules kind of like change the uh state of the air pressure in in like the local region where they are acting. And so they create in this process a wave. So in other words, we can think of sound as a wave that transmits transfer some energy from one point to another through air molecules. OK. But the question is what is a mechanical wave? And I'm talking about mechanical waves here because the sound is",
