In other words, Mal frequency seal coefficient or if we use their acronym MF CCS. But before we get started with this super cool topic, I want to remind you about the sound of the Ice L community. So if you sign up there, you can get feedback, share projects and share ideas with a community of people who are interested in A I audio A I music and audio signal processing. So I really invite you to check this community out and I'll leave you the link and the sign up link to the Slack workspace in the description box below. Now let's move on to the cool stuff. But before we get to M I want just like to remind you about what we did in the previous couple of videos and we focused on male spectrograms. Now male spectrograms are going to be like an important building block to understanding MF CCS. So if you are really not that familiar with that, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous couple of videos on male spectrograms. OK? But now let's get started with MFC",

            "text": "are a good candidate for using MF CCS. And that's because MF CCS are mainly time centric and they are more or less like pitch in variant, right? But obviously you wouldn't use uh MF CCS for, for example, like for identifying codes, right? Because you're not really getting that much of a uh that much pitch information good. So I think like you should really, really congratulate like yourself because uh we've done a lot of work like in this video. So we looked at the subs, we looked like at the math behind subst, we looked at the visualization of the subs how we can interpret subst in the context of speech. And then we moved on to male frequency subs coefficients. But up until up until now, we've just uh dealt with theory. So as it is usually the case in this series, uh the next step is gonna be that of implementation or just like playing around with Python.",
