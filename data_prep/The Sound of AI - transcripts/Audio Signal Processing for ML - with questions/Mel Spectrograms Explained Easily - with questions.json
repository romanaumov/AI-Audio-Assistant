This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform. And we also looked into extracting and visualizing spectrograms. Now, if you're not familiar with this concept, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous two videos, cos what I'm going to say next in the video builds on top of this two notions extensively. Now without further ado let's move on to this visualization of a spectrogram. And as you can see here on the X axis, we have time on the Y axis. As usual we have uh frequency and each point which is represented by a color in this two D representation uh tells us how present a certain frequency is at each point in time.",
