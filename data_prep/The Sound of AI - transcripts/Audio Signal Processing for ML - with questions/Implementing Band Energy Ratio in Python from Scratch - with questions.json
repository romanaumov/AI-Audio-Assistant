Last time, we looked at the theory behind a few frequency domain audio features. This time, I'm gonna implement one of those from scratch in Python. And the one that I'll be implementing is called band energy ratio. I'm not gonna get too much into the the theoretical details of this because I've done this like in the previous video. So if you find yourself not understanding what I'm talking about, just go back to my previous video which should be over here. OK? So let's take a look at this notebook. Uh And as you can see, I've already implemented some code and that's because this is like stuff that we've seen multiple times throughout this series and I didn't want to spend my time like coding, typing this down.",
