            "text": "Hi, everybody and welcome to another video in the audio processing for machine learning series. Last time we talked about basic features of sounds. So what sound is waveforms and introduce the concept of frequency. This time we continue delving into the features of sound, talking about intensity, power, loudness and timbre. So first of all, I want to talk about two, a couple of concepts. So intensity and power and these are like connected together. So let's start from the power of sound. Well, this is we all know how the power of sound, right? But we don't want to talk about the power of sound here. We actually want to talk about the reverse of that, the sound power. So what's the sound power? Well, this is a physical that we can express like this. It's basically the rate at which the energy is transferred. This is basically the idea of the concept of a power in general. But if we talk about sound power specifically, this is the energy per unit of time emitted by a sound source in all directions across, I mean like the air across like the the medium",

But don't worry because I'm going to cover like all of these things uh uh in depth and we're gonna have like quite a lot of fun going through all of these aspects of sound. OK. So let's start with sound envelope, which is called also amplitude envelope. So what's that? Well, when we think of a sound definitely like this is true for like um musical sounds like notes and things like that on different instruments. So the sound usually has like a an envelope, right? And so this envelope can be divided with a model that's called the A DS R model which stands for attack decay sustain release model. So basically, the idea is that uh the amplitude of these sounds has an initial spike and that's like the attack. So for example, is when you strike a key on a piano, you have like a spike in amplitude which also has uh some kind of like noisy sounds due to the hummers like of the of the piano. And that's like a type of like transient sound.",
