This time, we'll look into frequency domain audio features specifically. We'll be looking at the math and theory behind it. And I'm also gonna give you the intuition. But before we get started, I want to remind you about the sound of A I is Luck community, which is a community of people who are interested in all things A I audio music and signal processing. So you can join, get feedback on your projects and network with very cool people. So if you haven't joined yet, I highly suggest you to go check out the sign up link in the description box below. But now let's move on to the cool stuff. So in the last couple of videos, we looked into mal frequency subs coefficients or MF CCS.
