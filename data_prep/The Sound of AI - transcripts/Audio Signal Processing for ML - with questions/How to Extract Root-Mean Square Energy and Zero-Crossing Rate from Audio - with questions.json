This time we'll continue our quest into the time domain audio features and specifically we'll be extracting the root main squared energy and zero crossing rate features using uh Li Brosa. OK. So let's get started. But before that, I, yeah, I just wanted to tell you that we are going to be rehashing a lot of the code that I used in my previous video where I was extracting amplitude envelope. So yeah, let's just like grab some of this code from here. OK. So the first thing that I want to grab is just like this imports here. So as you can see, I'm importing my plot noon P Li Brosa Li Brosa display for just displaying the waveforms and then I Python display for uh playing audio directly in the Jupiter Notebook. OK. So the next thing that I want to do is just load uh some audio and today just like in the previous video, we're gonna be using three audio files that are like three",
