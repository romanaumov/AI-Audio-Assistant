Last time we learned about a short time, four year transform and spectrograms in a theoretical way. This time, it's time to actually use Python and the audio processing library lib browser to extract spectrograms from audio files. So let's get started. So I already wrote a Jupiter notebook here. And so I'm gonna just like run through it and I'm gonna tell you like what I'm doing and the different steps like to actually extract uh spectrogram. So the first thing that we want to do is just like import some uh like libraries. So we import OS so that we can uh load audio like our audio files, we import to Li Brosa Libres dot display for uh just like showing visualizing like the spectrograms and we'll import like noon pie and map lib dot plot for um actually doing or just like plotting uh the spectrograms like in other results that we'll have. OK. So let import all of this and then we want to just like load audio files with Li Brosa. So",
