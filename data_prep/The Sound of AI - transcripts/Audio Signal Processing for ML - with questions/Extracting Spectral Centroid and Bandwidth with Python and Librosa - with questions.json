So what I'm gonna do today is basically show you how you can calculate the spectral Centroid and the spectral bandwidth using libres. OK. So let's get started. So here, as you can see, I already fired up a notebook and wrote down like some stuff. So I'm not gonna go through this like in detail because we've seen this time and again, time and again throughout the series. But basically, so we have like all sorts of imports here with Lisa and other stuff that we'll use here. We are loading some audio files and we are always using the free usual audio files. So the bey piece, an orchestral piece, then a song by Red Hot Chili Peppers and then a nice ballad by Jake Eton. So this is a jazzy music. So here I just like display all of them. I'm not gonna play us back because like we've heard them like multiple times and if you're interested, you can download the uh the network and hear for yourself. And then what I do here, I load all the audio files with LIB browser so that we get both the uh the signal as a non power and the sample rate. OK. So it's now time to calculate the spectral Centroid with libros.",

You should have a very good understanding of the fourier transform and uh great understanding about MF CCS uh male spectrograms, spectrograms, uh log spectrograms. And so these are all ingredients that are will be necessary for your activity as an A I audio or A I music engineer or researcher. So yeah, congratulate like yourself because you did a lot of stuff if you follow it uh so far.
