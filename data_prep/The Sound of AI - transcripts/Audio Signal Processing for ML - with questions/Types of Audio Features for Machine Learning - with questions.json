This time, we're gonna introduce a few audio features, but mainly we're gonna be focusing on strategies that we can use to categorize this different audio features. Before we get into that, we should ask a couple of very important questions. One, what are audio features? Two, why are they important to us? Well, audio features are descriptors of sound. And the basic idea here is that when we have different audio features, they will tell us a different or they will uh provide us information about different aspects of sound. And the catch here is that we can use these audio features for training our intelligent audio systems. In other words, we should identify a few of these audio features we're interested in and then pass it into onto our um machine learning system so that they will hopefully like learn patterns and then solve our task or problems.
