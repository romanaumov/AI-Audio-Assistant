Many of you guys have asked me to dig deeper into audio digital signal processing and so here you have a whole series on that. In this video, I'm gonna give you a quick overview of the series, the different content, the things that you learn, the perquisites and the resources. Now, what's the problem? Why do we need this series? So the main issue that probably most deep learning engineers know is that when it comes time to work on deep learning applications for images, that's not that much of an issue because we have a lot of resources that explain how you can process image a road data and make it viable for deep learning and machine learning models. But that's not necessarily the case for audio, there's a sort of mist around audio data and how you should use it for",
