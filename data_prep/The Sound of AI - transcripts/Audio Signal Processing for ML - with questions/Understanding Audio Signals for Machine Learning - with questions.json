This time we start looking into audio signals and specifically we want to understand how we can take a sound and convert it into a digitalized audio signal that then we can use to manipulate it or to extract features and do whatever we want with it. Really? OK. But first of all, let's understand what's an audio signal. So this is a possible representation of a sound and this representation has all the info that we need in order to reproduce the sound once again to reconstruct it. OK? But we have to understand that here we have a huge problem and the problem is that on the one hand, sound is a mechanical wave that's analog in nature. And on the other, we want to process it with digital technologies like uh our computers, for example.",

And this uh let's just like a diaphragm, for example, like starts oscillating and this oscillation creates a unlock uh electrical signal and this electrical signal gets packed into a sound card which acts as an A DC device or analog to digital converter. And obviously it applies sampling and quantization and it also applies some anti liaising filtering so that it avoids liaising. And so for doing that, what we usually do is we have a low pass filter that cuts off all the frequencies that are above the NS frequency.
