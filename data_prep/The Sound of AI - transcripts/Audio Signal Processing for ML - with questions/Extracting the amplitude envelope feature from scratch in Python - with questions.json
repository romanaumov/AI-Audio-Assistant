And in the process, we'll also get familiar with Libros, which is the audio processing library that we'll use throughout this course. And we also plot waveforms and the amplitude envelope itself. Before getting, I wanted to show you the Libres documentation here. So you can check this out. I'll leave you the link in the description below. Interesting thing is that Libres doesn't have an extractor for amplitude envelope and so we'll build one from scratch. OK. So now let's get started. And so the first thing that we want to do is to, yeah, let's start by importing uh Li Broza. And we want to also import Li Brusa dot display that has utilities for plots for plotting stuff. OK.
