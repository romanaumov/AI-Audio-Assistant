Now, when I was uh planning this video, I thought what's the best way of introducing the fourier transform? And I thought, well, perhaps I should just give you a little bit of intuition there and then go straight into uh implementation or even just use the browser for extracting a spectrum through the fourier transform. But then I thought, well, the fourier transform is at core of signal processing. So just sprinkling a little bit of math here and there and intuition is not going to be enough for you. So you really want to have a deep understanding of the fourier transform and all of its implications. This is why I've decided to divide this topic into a number of videos.

So in adjective synthesis, you have synthesizers which basically use different sinusoids and you can superimpose them. So combined by adding them up um in order to create complex sounds.
