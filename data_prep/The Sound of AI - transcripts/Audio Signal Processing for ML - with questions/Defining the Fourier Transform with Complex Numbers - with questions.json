Last time we introduced complex numbers and we said that we would need this to introduce many aspects of audio signal processing. And so this time we'll just build on top of that knowledge and we'll use complex numbers to define the fourier transform in complex terms. And as you'll see, this is gonna be super compact and super elegant. But before we get started, I just want to remind you about the sound of the I Slack community here. You can talk with a lot of like cool people who are interested in A IOU and A I music and you can also get feedback. So I really suggest you to check this out. I'll leave you the sign up link in the description below now onto the cool stuff. So I want to remind you about like a couple of things that I introduced some math stuff that I introduced over the last couple of meters. And the first couple of formulas are these two and this is the formula on top over here for um getting like the face as a parameter of the fourier transform. And then we have the mag",

So here I can pass a pure turn frequency and I'll put this equal to one Hertz for the time being. And this is basically, it's gonna build a uh a sine wave and that's gonna be like our exponential over here. And then we're gonna have the signal frequency and we need to pass that in and I'll pass in that equal to one. And what that will do behind the scenes is that it will create this signal.
