And specifically, we're gonna look at the theory behind it. So we'll look at two very important algorithms backward propagation and gradient the sound cool. So let's get started with the idea of training a neural network. So the high level overview. So what do we do when we train a network? Well, we basically trick all the weights of the connections among different neurons so that we can have predictions that are really good. So how do we do that? Well, we basically uh feed some training data. So inputs and target values to the network, then we look at the predictions and we calculate the error between the predictions and the expected outcome. And then we use that information for iteratively adjusting the weights I know like this feels like very high level. So we're gonna now look at how that's done precisely cool. So again, from a quite high level overview, there are two main steps here. So when we train a network, we pass a sample, an example",
