This time around, we're gonna talk about artificial neurons and we're gonna both understand the theory behind it and also implement them in Python. So a little bit more of a focus on what we'll be learning. So we'll have a quick look at a biological neurons. Obviously, it's not gonna be a neuro class by any means, it's just gonna be like some very introductory uh things about biological neurons. And then we're gonna move on to artificial neurons and see a little bit how the math works behind it and understanding the uh the theory there and then we'll move on and we're gonna basically implement an artificial neuron from scratch in Python. So let's get started. Uh the picture you have here is that of a biological neuron. So as you see, this is a quite complex system with a bunch of like different things, but we are mainly interested in three aspects of it.
