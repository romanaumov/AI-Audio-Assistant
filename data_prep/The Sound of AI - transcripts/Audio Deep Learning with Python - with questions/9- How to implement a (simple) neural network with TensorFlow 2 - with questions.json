Is this amazing deep learning library that's like used very much in the industry and also in academia and it has its own way of building and processing information and neural networks. So obviously, we're gonna follow that. So what should we do? Well, first thing that we want to do is to build a model. So we need to build the architecture of our network. Then once we have the architecture, we want to compile the model, which basically means passing information like the error function that we want to use or like the optimizer that we want to use uh in our training uh process. Then we indeed want to train the model",

And then once you're done with that, you're gonna use the test set to evaluate how well the model is doing on some data that uh the neural network has never seen before. And why do we do that? Well, we do that because uh we want to see whether the neural network has been able to generalize the patterns that it has learned by uh training on a data set on the training set. And so in order to do that, we need to evaluate the um model on some data that the network has never seen before. So all we need to do here is to split our data set into some training set. And uh a test set so we could do this like from scratch. But there's a very handy function that does this like for us. So I don't want to re invent the wheel here.
