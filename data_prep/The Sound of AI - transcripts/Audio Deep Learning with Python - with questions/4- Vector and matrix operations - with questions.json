So that's why in this video we're going to talk about vector and matrix operations. So let's get started with vectors. What are vectors? Well, vectors are just a ray of numbers. We notate vectors with small caps bolts, a letter like this a vector here. And then we can arrange a vector that's a collection of different items both horizontally. And then we have a row vector or vertically and we have a column vector. So on vectors, we can perform a number of different operations",

So this is why uh we basically use a lot of like doll products and linear algebra uh for uh notating uh neural nets. And that's very, very convenient. So this was it like for uh the basic operations for vectors. Now let's move on to matrices. So what's a matrix? So a matrix is a rectangular grid of numbers. It's like a spreadsheet really?

So we have this matrix ABC D and we want to add a second matrix which is 1234. And as you can see here, the sum matrix here is given by the addition of the elements of the first matrix with the respective elements of the second matrix. So for element 11, so row one, column one, we are adding a and one together. So a being the first uh being element um in row one column one from the first matrix and one being element uh 11 uh from the second matrix. And then we, we do the same thing for element um 21. So row two, column one and here we add B plus two and as you can see here, so here we have B and here we have two, then we do C plus three and D plus four. So it's very simple. And in this way, we can calculate super easily, both addition and subtraction. So now",
