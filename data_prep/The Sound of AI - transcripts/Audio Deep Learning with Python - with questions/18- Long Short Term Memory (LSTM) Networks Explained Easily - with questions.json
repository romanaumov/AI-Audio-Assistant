This time, we're gonna introduce a super exciting type of network recurrent network called a long short term memory network, right? But before getting into that, let's remember like what we've done uh last time and why we need this LST MS, right? So we la in the last video, we looked into simple R and MS and we saw that they're really good for time series type of data. But we also found out that they have a few issues mainly that they really don't have a long term memory and that's uh the network can't really uh use like context from the past. And that's because like it can't learn patterns with a long dependencies. And this is like a huge issue as we've seen last time because I mean, a lot of like audio music data uh depends like on long patterns. And so we need to find a way to overcome this issue",
