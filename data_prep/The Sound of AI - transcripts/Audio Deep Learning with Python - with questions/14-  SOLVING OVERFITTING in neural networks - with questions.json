So specifically, we're gonna look into techniques that we can use to identify overfitting and then to solve it. Cool. So if you guys remember last time we built a multi layer of perception that's able to do music genre classification, but we had a issue and the issue was overfitting, which basically means that the uh model was doing very well on the training set, but it was having issues with data, it had never seen before, right? So first of all, what we want to do is find a way of identifying all the fitting. And for doing that, we can use a couple of plots that are very informative. So it's basically taking a look at the accuracy and the error of both the train set and uh the test set over time over all the epochs and training cycles. So for doing that, obviously, we need to retain information about the training process. And uh fortunately for us, tensorflow has a super",
