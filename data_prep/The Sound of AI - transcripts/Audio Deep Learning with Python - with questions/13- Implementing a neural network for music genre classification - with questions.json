This time we're gonna build a music genre classifier using a multi-layered perception network. Cool. So music genre classification is a type of problem that's called a classification problem, right? So what's a classification problem? Well, classification problem is I have uh a bunch of data and I want to classify that. So I have for example, like a bunch of uh tracks and I want to classify them into like rock music, uh blues music or like classical music, specifically what we're doing today is called multi class classification. So we have a bunch of tracks and those vinyls would uh want to like represent those tracks and then we want to classify them into a bunch of different genres, right? So it could be classical, it could be death metal could be EDM and whatever, right? But it's more than two and multi class classification is opposed to binary classification where we just have two categories out there. So for example, it could be uh tell me",

Well, because if you remember we have NF CCS here for each uh segment, for each track and for each track, we have many MFCC vectors and each MFCC vector is taken at a specific interval. So and that is like the hop length again, if you don't remember like what MF CCS are or uh how we calculate them, I have a video about that. Go watch that out. Cool.
