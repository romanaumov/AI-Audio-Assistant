This time you are going to preprocess audio data and get it ready for our deep learning applications. So, and specifically, we're gonna look into how to visualize and learn waveforms, how to perform fourier transforms for getting spectrums, how we get spectrograms and how we extract MF CCS. Now, if all of this sounds like gibberish, you should definitely like watch uh my previous video where I cover like the theoretical side of all of these things. But uh let's just like get started. So we're not gonna build like any of these algorithms for like performing fourier transforms or extracting MF CCS from scratch. But rather we're gonna rely on a great audio analysis uh library called Libros. And so first thing we wanna do its import uh Libros.",
