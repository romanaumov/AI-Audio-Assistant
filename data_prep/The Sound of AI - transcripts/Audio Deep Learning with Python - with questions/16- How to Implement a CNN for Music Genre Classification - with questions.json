This time, we're gonna build a convolutional neural network for performing music genre classification. So basically, we're building on top of the previous video where we reviewed. Uh Well, we analyze what a CNN is and how it works as well as like the work that we've done on previous videos on uh music genre classification using a multi layer perception. Now, this is gonna be like a quite intense video. So just like take it and uh relax uh but this is gonna be fun for real. OK. So what I want to do first is just like provide all the different steps, high level steps that we need to go through to build uh like this um CNM. And so uh let me just like start by doing if name is equal to main, right? OK. And so here I'll just like jot down all the different steps. So let's start from the first one. So we want to create a train validation and test sets. Now we've already seen the train and test set. Uh We don't really know that much about validation set or cross validation. So, and we'll see that like in a second. But before let's go through like all the different steps here.",

And the main reason for that is because like, it's a lot of like uh stuff that we're gonna write. And so I don't want to like have a lot of mass. So I prefer just like to modular everything. By the way, this is a good, a very good advice if you have like a lot of instructions that go well, like together, even if you're doing just like simple scripting, just try like to, to use like either functional programming or like object oriented programming. So that, I mean, you don't end up like with a lot of like instructions that are difficult to understand. OK. So we'll do so we expect like the model itself. And so we'll create a uh function here that we'll call it uh built model. And now this function is gonna accept an argument uh that's called uh the input shape, right?

But then by the end of this, we're gonna try to predict the sample, the sample at index 100 like in the test set, right? And see if the, the model is predicting it correctly. So now let me run the scripts, I'll post the video and just go back, come back when uh we have a results and here we are back guys. So here we have our results. So the expected index for uh our sample was nine, which we know is uh yeah, let's take it here. It's metal, right? So this was a uh as a metal sample and the predicted index was nine good. OK. So the uh the model I performed correctly in this instance. Nice. So guys, we are done, this was like a quite intense video and I hope you like you really enjoyed that because now you know how to build like a CNN",

So guys, we are done, this was like a quite intense video and I hope you like you really enjoyed that because now you know how to build like a CNN uh classifier. And this like music genre classifier is doing like pretty well overall. Uh So like for next video, we're gonna start looking into recurrent neural networks. So which are like another architecture, another type of architecture that's very important like with audio data, like music data more specifically because like we can interpret that as like time series, right?",
