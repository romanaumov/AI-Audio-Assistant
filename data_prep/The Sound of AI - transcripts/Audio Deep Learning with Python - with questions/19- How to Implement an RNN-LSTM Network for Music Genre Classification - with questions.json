So the training process has finished and we got the results here and the test accuracy is 64% which is a quite decent result given we have 10 different um genres. And yeah, and I think like it's probably close to the result that we also got with the CNN. Good. So yeah, I guess like this is like it for this video now, you know how to build an RNN long short term memory network, which is great. Cool. So at the same time, this is the end of the deep learning for audio with Python series. And by now if you followed it, you should be able to like build your own models and carers, be able to uh process all your data extract MF CS, perform fourier transforms and do like a bunch more things and have an understanding like of all your data more in general.",
