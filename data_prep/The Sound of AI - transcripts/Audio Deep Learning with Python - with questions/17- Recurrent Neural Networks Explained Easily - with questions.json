This time we're gonna talk about recurrent neural networks and understand the theory behind it. So let's get started and understand what R and NS are, what they do, what type of data they process. Now there's a lot of data in which order is extremely important. That's true. For example, like for text and words. So let's analyze for example, the the sentence Anna loves John. Well, here order is very important because Anna loves John is very different from John loves Anna, right? And the point being that like order is so important that many like bad things can happen. Like if you don't understand whether like Anna loves you or John loves Anna, right? OK. So in that sense, like order is very important for data, certain type of data like time series as well where we have like data uh which are like measures like of of different values that are taken like a certain intervals and ordered like over time, right?",

So for example, if you use an R and M for generating a melody, so what you can do basically is you provide uh an input and this is a sequence um a melody, right? So we have like a sequence of notes and there are the, you are interested in the next notes, but you're not necessarily interested into like the previous notes, right. OK. So this is a sequence to vector RNN and it's opposed to a sequence to sequence RNN. Here we consider like uh as an output all the outputs at each time step. And so basically here, the idea is that we uh input a batch of sequences and then we get as an output a bunch of sequences again, right? So this is a little bit of less common",
