And to do that, we're gonna expand on the work we've done uh a couple of videos ago when we implemented a multi layer perception class, this M LP objects here. And uh in that case, we built a uh constructor where basically we built like the, the structure of the network. And then we mainly uh focused on this forward propagate method uh which is basically forward propagation which computes the inputs uh which travel uh from left to right and gives us a prediction good. So what are we gonna do specifically like this time around? Well, it's a bunch of like different things and so it's better just like to write them down so that we'll have more or less like a direction that we know we're following because by the way, this is gonna be like a quite intense view and probably quite long as well good.

So we, we made it, we trained our network, we have this like network which is an absolute overkill for calculating like the same operation. But yeah, we made it. But apart from like the the toy application, I think like what we made it here like it's quite something because we made to basically build a whole neural network, fit forward neural network, multi layer perception from scratch. And now we have all of the different elements to it. We have forward propagation, we have back propagation, we have gradient descent, we know how we can train it uh everything like it's super modular because you can put like as many uh layers uh in the network as you want and you can specify as many like neurons as you want like, so that's like also like really nice.
