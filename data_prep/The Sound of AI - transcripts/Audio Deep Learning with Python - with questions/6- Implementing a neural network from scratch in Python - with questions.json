This time we're gonna implement a neural network from scratch specifically, we're gonna implement a multi layer perception. So let's get started. So the first thing that we want to do is importing numpy the nun P if you're not familiar with it is a um scientific library for Python that's used in most uh libraries if you don't have nun pie installed. So you, you just go and go to your terminal and pip install it. It's quite straightforward, right? So uh the thing that we want to build here is a class that's called M LP or multi layer perception. So here we're gonna have all the attributes and methods that we can use to actually represent a multi layer of perception.",

            "text": "just finished implementing a neural network from scratch. So you now know more than most people like out there about how to actually create a neural network like from scratch. And now you may be wondering, OK, but there's an elephant in the room here and that's that we haven't uh trained like our network at all. So how do we do that? Well, this is a huge topic in itself and it's gonna be the focus of my next video where I'm gonna basically explain the theory behind back propagation and gradient descent uh which are like the two approaches, the two techniques which we used to uh train network with uh some uh training data set. So yeah, next time we're gonna do that. So I hope you enjoyed this video if you did. Uh And if you want to get like more videos, remember to subscribe and hit the notification bell. Uh because that way you're gonna get like all the videos once I upload them and if you like again the video just like also leave a like and I guess I'll see you next time. Cheers.",
