Uh What we're gonna do today really is uh preparing uh it's basically like doing some preprocessing on a music data set. So what we want to do really is extract the inputs and the targets. So basically like the uh labels and the MFCC uh from music data set and store that in adjacent files. So that then we can use it when we actually train our neural network. So, first of all, what we need for a music genre classifier is a music data set. And uh luckily there's a great one on the Marias uh website where we have this uh data set for genre classification. So you can go to the website and download it here. I'm not gonna do that because I already have it. But uh",
