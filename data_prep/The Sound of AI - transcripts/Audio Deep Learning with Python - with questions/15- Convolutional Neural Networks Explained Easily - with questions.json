This time, it's super exciting because we are looking into convolutional neural networks and we'll try to explain how they work on a theoretical level, right? So what are CNN S? Well CNN S are quite advanced type of um neural network. And they've been mainly used for processing images. And over time, we've found out that they are way better at performing liquid images than the equivalent, for example, like multi-layered perception uh architecture. And the the great thing about CNN S is that they have at the same time way less parameters than dense layers. So when analyzing images, we have this double advantage, so they perform better and they have less parameters than the multi layer perception. But now you may be wondering, but why is that the case? Well, it turns out that image data is somehow uh structured.",

And so like it's good to get like into that like frame of mind. Wow. So this was intense. But at the same time now, you should have a quite clear understanding of a convolutional neural network, what its components are, what's like uh the the processes that come into place, how uh like convolutional pooling layers like work and how the overall architecture like is built together. So we should just ask ourselves as usual at the end of these videos and say what's up next? Well, as usual, we'll take all of this theoretical uh information and in the next video we're gonna uh put that into practice. So what we'll do is implementing a music genre classifier. But this time we are gonna be using a CNN.",
