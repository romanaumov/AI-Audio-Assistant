Specifically, we're gonna look into waveforms, sound concepts like pitch loudness and things that are a little bit more advanced, like spectrograms, fourier transform and MF CCS. And we're gonna need all of these elements because these are the bases we'll need for implementing audio and music, deep learning models. Cool. So a disclaimer is needed here. So I'm not, this is not a comprehensive video on audio, digital signal processing rather. It, it will give you just like the the basic foundations you'll need for like deep learning in this field. But if you want to know more about this fascinating topic, like let me know in the comments section and I may make a few videos on the topic moving forward. Cool. So let's get started.

So now again, so as you've seen, I haven't gone into like the deep mathematical details or implementation details, both of like the fourier transform and MF CCS because we don't need them. But again, if you are like interested in knowing more, just like let me know in the comments section. And once I'm done like with the series, uh I could actually like make a few videos about this and if you are very interested in that I could actually create a series about all your digital signal processing, which is a fascinating topic in itself and very complex. Cool. OK. So now how do we use like MF CCS like in the uh preprocessing pipeline? Like for a data? Well, it's basically the same thing that we do like for a spectrogram.
