In this video, we're gonna have an overview at artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. These are some of the uh topics that we're gonna be covering during the video. So we're gonna define artificial intelligence and see the relationship with machine learning and deep learning. And then we're going to talk about a number of different machine learning flavors or paradigms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Then we're gonna get into de defining deep learning and then we're gonna see the difference between traditional machine learning and deep learning. And finally, we're gonna be talking a little bit about possible applications of deep learning in audio and music technology. Cool. So let's get started with uh the relationship between artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. Usually",

So we can use deep learning for uh tasks like speech recognition for uh classifying emotions just by looking at or analyzing voice or for doing things like no recognition. And in the music side of things that sometimes gets called music information retrieval. We can use deep learning to extract or to classify music genre to understand the different types of instruments that we have in a song and then also for doing mood classification. So we have a bunch of different songs and we should decide, is this a happy song or is this a sad song? And then we can use deep learning for doing music tagging. So basically to, to, to put tags onto different songs. And then the thing like, that's the most exciting for me and the work that I've also done like at Melo Drive.",
