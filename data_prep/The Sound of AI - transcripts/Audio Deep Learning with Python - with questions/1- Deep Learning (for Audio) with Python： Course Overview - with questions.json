So first of all, I want you to understand the capabilities and limits of deep learning. So what's possible and what's not possible? Then after that, we're gonna learn a lot about the fundamental theory behind neural networks. We're gonna learn a little bit about the math, for example, that powers this very powerful algorithms. And then we're gonna move on to more practice based stuff and we're gonna learn how to code deep learning uh networks using industry standards, deep learning libraries like tensorflow. And then obviously we're going to play around with a bunch of different types of neural networks. So like R and MS CNN s and we're gonna learn what all of these acronyms like really stand for. Cool.

Now, I'm not gonna go super deep into math because at the end of the day, this is not a math course, but you're gonna learn quite a lot about basic linear algebra and derivatives and these kind of things because we need them to understand how neural networks work and how to tweak them in order to have like very effective uh like uh algorithms for solving our problems.
