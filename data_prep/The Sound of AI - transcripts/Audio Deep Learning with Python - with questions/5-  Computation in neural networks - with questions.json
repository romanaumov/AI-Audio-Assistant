I'm gonna introduce you the multi-layered perception, which is a simple neural network and we're gonna see how it works and the math behind it. So to get started, let's take a look at an old friend, the artificial neuron. So if you remember, we, we said that an artificial neuron is a computational unit that's able to process some information and do some transformation on it. Well, the question is, so if the artificial neuron is a computational unit, why do we need a neural network? Isn't an artificial neuron good enough by itself? Well, it turns out that if you want to work on quite complex problems, you want to scale up to networks of neurons or neural networks because a single neuron is really good if you are",

            "text": "to reiterate the fact that the important elements of a computation in a neural network are the weights which are represented with matrices, the net inputs which are represented as row vectors and activations which again are represented as row vectors and are the outputs of a layer onto the next layer. Cool. So this was it for this video. And you may be wondering so what's up next? Well, we've done the theory behind um multi layer perceptions and neural networks. So now uh we are going to have the fun part which is coding a multi layer perception from scratch only using Python. Cool. So I hope you enjoyed the video if that's the case just uh leave a like you can subscribe and if you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment in the comments section below and that's it for now and I hope I'll see you next time. Cheers.",
