So what I'm gonna do today is basically show you how you can calculate the spectral Centroid and the spectral bandwidth using libres. OK. So let's get started. So here, as you can see, I already fired up a notebook and wrote down like some stuff. So I'm not gonna go through this like in detail because we've seen this time and again, time and again throughout the series. But basically, so we have like all sorts of imports here with Lisa and other stuff that we'll use here. We are loading some audio files and we are always using the free usual audio files. So the bey piece, an orchestral piece, then a song by Red Hot Chili Peppers and then a nice ballad by Jake Eton. So this is a jazzy music. So here I just like display all of them. I'm not gonna play us back because like we've heard them like multiple times and if you're interested, you can download the uh the network and hear for yourself. And then what I do here, I load all the audio files with LIB browser so that we get both the uh the signal as a non power and the sample rate. OK. So it's now time to calculate the spectral Centroid with libros.",

And the basic idea here is that when we have different audio features, they will tell us a different or they will uh provide us information about different aspects of sound. And the catch here is that we can use these audio features for training our intelligent audio systems.

So this is like a an incredible book in music information Retrieval. And I highly suggest you to check that out. But let's focus on this uh strategy like for classifying audio features. So uh what's low level features? So what are these, well, these are features that make sense for the machine, but don't make that much sense for us human beings.

So it's minus 0.5 times 10 and we get minus five. OK. So you, you get the idea here.

So what sound is waveforms and introduce the concept of frequency. This time we continue delving into the features of sound, talking about intensity, power, loudness and timbre. So first of all, I want to talk about two, a couple of concepts. So intensity and power and these are like connected together. So let's start from the power of sound. Well, this is we all know how the power of sound, right? But we don't want to talk about the power of sound here. We actually want to talk about the reverse of that, the sound power. So what's the sound power? Well, this is a physical that we can express like this. It's basically the rate at which the energy is transferred. This is basically the idea of the concept of a power in general.

So uh one thing that I want to say is like uh as a keyboard player, unfortunately, we don't have this luxury of having like a vibrato, but sometimes like, you'll see pianists who like kind of like strike a key and then after that, they kind of try to do every brow, obviously that doesn't have like any effect on the sound. But still if you have that, so it's a, it's like a nice, like quirk. OK. But if you have a midi keyboard, uh midi keyboards have this thing which is like after touch, like and after like you strike a key, then you can like vibrate the sound and it's gonna like vibrate but not on a piano. I can assure you that I've tried. It doesn't work. OK. Uh So now the other type of like modulation that we have is called amplitude modulation.

Last time we learned about a short time, four year transform and spectrograms in a theoretical way. This time, it's time to actually use Python and the audio processing library lib browser to extract spectrograms from audio files. So let's get started. So I already wrote a Jupiter notebook here. And so I'm gonna just like run through it and I'm gonna tell you like what I'm doing and the different steps like to actually extract uh spectrogram. So the first thing that we want to do is just like import some uh like libraries. So we import OS so that we can uh load audio like our audio files, we import to Li Brosa Libres dot display for uh just like showing visualizing like the spectrograms and we'll import like noon pie and map lib dot plot for um actually doing or just like plotting uh the spectrograms like in other results that we'll have.

Well, gamma is the angle between the positive uh real axis and the line that connects the origin with the complex number. So in other words, it's this angle over here.

We aren't done yet with complex numbers though. So there are a few other concepts that we use and that are super useful for representing in a nicer handy way our fourier transform. So let's just take a look at them. So one of this is the Euler formula, basically what we are looking at here is E to the I times gamma, which is equal to cosine of gamma plus I sine gamma. Now, if you're wondering about e this is the base of the natural logarithm. Now this is like a very, very nice formula. And uh it's kind of looks similar to what we are looking at at our um a polar representation of the complex numbers. But let's try to visualize and understand what this is on a plot, what this exponential is on a plot. And so as you can see here, so what the exponential does, it basically traces the unit circle.

So the NUS frequency for CD is kind of like very close to that. And so why is that the case? Well, that's the case because this means that we can go up to 22 K plus in Hertz and still not have any artifacts there.",

But the cool thing here is that we have like way less like variability and outliers. And that's because for the R MS, we are considering all the samples in a frame, we're not just like taking the max uh value of the amplitude for a given sample inside like the the A frame, right? And uh now uh just like for the sake of comparison, let's just compare the amplitude envelope. So this is the amplitude envelope for the BC for red hot peppers and Duke Kington as we extracted like last time and compare that against this, the R MS. And as you can see as I was mentioning, so here like this, this just like go it goes crazy, right?

OK. So these are the 310 domain features that we'll be uh focusing on today. So these are amplitude envelope root mean square energy and zero crossing rate. So all of these features are low level acoustic features and they are instantaneous. In other words, we take these features at each frame in an audio signal, then obviously, we can just like take like all of these values that we have for each frame and then we can aggregate them with some statistical means like mean sum or things that are a little bit more sophisticated like Gaussian mixture models. And but yeah, so if you don't remember like the definition of a frame or like the categorization of audio features, I highly suggest you go check out this video up here that will clarify all of those things for you.

So we divide like this green power here by the uh the power here like in this uh blue bar and that is the band energy ratio. Ok. So what can we use the band to energy ratio for? Well, we can use it for all sorts of things uh in music and speech processing and specifically band energy ratio has been extensively used in to discriminate music from speech and for certain music classification problems like music genre classification or mood uh classification.

But now with this idea in mind and with this basic understanding, you can go there and you can easily understand all the other ones that are out there. So what's up next? Well, we talked about the theory behind this uh frequency domain audio features in this video. Next, we're gonna be implementing uh one of these audio features from scratch and that's the band energy ratio and we use Python for doing that as we've done throughout this series. And then we're going to be visualizing the uh band energy ratio for pieces of music in different genres and try to understand if we can tell them apart based only on the band energy uh ratio.

So the first thing that we wanna do is just like import a bunch of like packages. So li browser, li browser doc display and map, put lip just like for review stuff. Next, we want to actually load uh an audio file with lib browser. So the first thing that we'll do is just um get a reference to uh the path to the file.

So what we can do is just like move this number of mel bands over here from 90 to say 10 and just like rerun the whole thing. Uh So yeah, now, obviously like the mass spectrogram shape is equal to 10 uh and 342 as the second dimension because we have 10 mel bands. OK. So moving on. So yeah, and now we actually see that on the X axis, we have like 10 discrete blocks, right? So we have 123456789 and 10 over there. Cool. OK.

So I'll import Li Brosa Libros dot display, ipython dot display, uh Pylot and then pie. So let's do that. Next thing we want to load uh an audio file. So which file are we gonna load?
